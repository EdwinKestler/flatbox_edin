Remote math inclusive education for the vision impaired

This is our first attempt to bring remote math edcuation to vision impaired persons. 

#IoT to empower humans. 

Hardware: Raspberry pi 4, 4GB Gateway paired via Wifi to Haptic interfase (drv2603) with response mechanism (MAX6817 de bounce) (vibration motors and push buttons) 2 units. 
IoT: JSON, MQTT, WiFi.
Software: Rabbit MQ, Node-Red, Maria DB, Node.js Angular 9
Cloud: Goolge cloud-> BigQuery, Pub/Sub, Cloud Functions (python and Node.js) 

Main Idea: so a teacher can remotely teach math  to many vision imparied studentes. 1 to many or 1 to 1, via the internet and aremote conference call
